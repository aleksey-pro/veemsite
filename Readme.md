Features:

1. Used LESS preprocessor (I think SASS would be excessive in this case)
2. Used Bootstrap 3 grid system (I think this would be more reliable for responsiveness and browser capability), customized accordingly to the project layout.
3. Aim to fit original layout

About the task to increase conversion.

 - I would double the download submit form to the bottom of the page. In this case a client could fill it after reading all the information, without scrolling the page up.
 - I would place a customers reviews after describing every feature. In the reviews they would tell how the feature had helped them to solve a task.
